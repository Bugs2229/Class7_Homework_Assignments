Terraform Day 1

You need the following 5 checks to ensure that Terraform works correctly for you.

1: Ensure that AWS Agent is installed correctly.
Command: aws configure


If you don’t have the keys installed or you don’t have this software installed, then please talk to your group leader.

2: Ensure that Terraform is installed

Type:     terraform --version





NOTE: I don’t care if your version of Terraform is out of date, please don’t waste class time regarding this. Instead simply update Terraform if you want. Terraform will still operate even if you use an older version

This will auto update.  
Then check
terraform --version
